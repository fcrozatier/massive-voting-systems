# Voting Systems for Massive Competitions

The problem: choosing a voting system for an event like a massive competition, as most voting systems were not designed to deal with sparse data.

This repo implements and benchmarks different voting systems for massive competitions and tries to answer the natural question: is there a better approach?

## Implemented voting systems

- Bradley-Terry
- Crowd BT
- PageRank
- Schulze
- Majority Judgement

## Benchmark

The benchmark is done as follow:

We start by generating a random ranking on N entries, which would be the 'true' ranking.

The best voting systems should correctly infer the true ranking from the aggregation of individual rankings.
