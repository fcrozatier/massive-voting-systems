# Massive Voting Systems

Voting systems for massive competitions

## Description

This repo implements and benchmarks different voting systems for massive competitions and tries to answer the natural question: is there a better approach?

## Benchmarking

To benchmark and compare the voting systems we start by generating a random ranking on N entries, their "true" ranking.

The best voting systems correctly infer the true ranking from the aggregation of individual rankings.
