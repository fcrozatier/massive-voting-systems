# Massive Voting Systems

Voting systems for massive competitions

## Description

This repo implements and benchmarks different voting systems for massive competitions and tries to answer the natural question: is there a better approach?

## Benchmarking

The benchmark is done as follow:

We start by generating a random ranking on N entries, which would be their 'true' ranking.

The best voting systems should correctly infer the true ranking from the aggregation of individual rankings.

We measure how close the inferred ranking is to the true ranking when varying the number of votes and the noise on each vote.
